Currently 11.58pm Still WED the 7th of may
I honhetly feel like I have made some progress today, "progress in moving forward to the future I know is possible.
I need to finish sorting the remaining box of stuff
You need to remove all clutter, essentially all possible distractions.
You don't need possesions that don't ultitmely serve the purpose of growing/snowballing your life.
You have listed the high priotry tasks/hurdles that need to be done, you have chatGPTed the fuck out of mutiple roadmaps, you know most of the plans are completly viable;..\
YOU JUST NEED FUCKING RAW ACTION - you need to switch to DOING mode, you have been in a incredibily deep planing/thinking/learning phase on and off sinse you were 15+, you have known what you want in life for over a fucking decade now...
You've expreinced alot.. 
You lost your mother to drugs, father too but he actually had to be there to begin with to actually lose him, though alcolic-full-time working micheal was far from perfect, some would say a shit father, but compared to what was to come, was a daydream...
you had to watch them become former shells of who they were, the anger, the aggression, the cooked actions, the comedowns, the highs, burning through all $$, while being completlely aware that I was getting sucked into the lifestyle, as years go by, the anger/build up of dealing with them started to become overwheleming, the absloute lack of guidence from essesntially the get-go in my adolensense throughout my teens and into my adulthood left me to learn to understand the world/myself by myself, there was no displince, structure, routine, there was no rules... there was no constent male role model around me to learn from, I spent many years chasing my big brother to bond/hangout/be close brothers, but it was fututile, he didn't like being around me, probably resented me abit for eating resources that could of been hes, he also didn't have any male role-models to learn from, Micheal/Father was a fucking asshole and a drunk...
broke mums heart mutiple times, knocked up donna and left my mum/me/dylan to move in with her and be the father to he's daughter, our step-sister... Maybe i'm bias, but what the fuck, to then see us on the weekend every 2 weeks, evenutally being dumped by her and essesntially inheriting the braybrook house from my grandma who died, eventually dylan got to the age he got to opt out, as weekends were boring as he worked mon-fri full time, so would spent the weekend ripping through a slab + of VB wth he's best friend, my non blood relalted patched hells angels uncle "Keith". to me was a amanaing role-model, that genually cared for myself/brother'/mother and ofcourse micheal. as years carried on, I would become ingrossed in the criminal elelemts of my dads/uncles/friends past, from running a whole grow house, Bar antics, cultivating a hard personalitlity, boxer / old school tatted up, defentily a hard worker and played hard to. I was lucky enough to be in the dead singularity of computers/Internet exploding into what would become our realilty, as I do remember a time without phones/before dial-up, the old-school spinny home phone that would take 10 years to make a call... everything changed rapidly and has been ever since, I became addicted/entranced in playing games/watching anime/being online, There was a key convosation that would be a driving factor in the form of planning into my fututre and it was when I would get into the past of micheal, there was a qoute I can remmeber word for word, $$$ would go in one hand and out the other, essesntially playing hard, back in those days, was long before the internet/computers so it's hard to imagine but there was a fundemental lack of free access to infomation, in my thinking investment oppurtunties/avunues, the Income from a Grow-house with every room being used, 1 room 1 plant, 1x1000watt hps/mh with CO2 Injection - full hyrdo, and bypassing the eletricicty meter "aka using free power" would of been insane, stumbling upon what he says was just part of the setup equitmpent stored away in hes shed, "It was a fucking alot" and me already being a few years into smoking weed was a done-deal, I started learning from theory/online, startted planning, but atlas with a utter lack of displince, finances, "Help/guidence" + the upcoming transition into him starting to smoke ice, therefore mother too.. to much choas, mind fuckery to the point where after getting home from a thur-sun/mon morning work weekened in the club, "Little red pocket to be exact, being coked up myself, and getting into one last fight with micheal, that would be the last, Calling him out on the junkie he had essestinally become, obvilous to him ofcourse, ice/meth wasen't a big deal to them, they didn't see it for what is was,  I say this with 100% convition and clairty now but back then I was just as obliouus to the effects/domino effects that smoking that shit would unfold, Dylan would make one last plead where he was in tears, asking them to stop, while it was a joke/funny to them in the sense that i guess it wasen't a problem/warped view, but at the time, I was the one that would directly tell him to not bother as I knew the answer, and was alot younger then him, alot more intrenched in there world/"hes world" then dylan, Dylan fell in love early, was a 100% selfish dick, with he's partner and hes best friend exlcuded from that, not me though ; ), I was just the annoying younger brother with anger issues, a drive to fuck shit up, get into all types of trouble, getting arrested at early age for breaking into primary school with best friends/nextdoor neighboors /Bulent and sedat for absolityuely trashing the art/spare space extention to the school that had left a fucking door unlocked, I really didn't start thinking about my actions until earlier in my 20's, I wasen't to smart, "hence didn't think about the possible outcomes to my actions, which coupled with a out of control anger issue would get me into alot of stupid shit.I i rant.... but I knew they didn't give a fuck about he's plea, as neither did I, He could probbably at the time still have a vision of what could of been, I was not older enough nor looking out at life with any compareabable vison..... 
Shit got dark real quick. 
glossing over this as i'm just free-thinking this as i go, eventually getting kicked out for the last time, with no where to go, No finances, a bussie/bar job that would slingshot me into a completlely new direction in-life, "NOTE-TO-COMPLETE-LATER" from that day to moving in with Sam in glenroy, to ditching there to stay with the the girl I was seeings place as she was in saintkilda, Sung regulary at little red, and was alot older, me being 19/20 at the time her being 28+, having her own place that parents left her, a car, ect, while I had just left everything I had brught from braybrook to glenroy there at sams, being my computer/clothes ... Computer meant the world to me, but i wasen't a offical move out, it was jjust the rarely staying there, as it was just a no-brainer and I would start to get into a scary routine of working/going-out-back-to-work and pushing it by repeating, all the while smashing alachol/speed/cold during, There I meet kenny the fucking creature..... Obviously being completlely destoryed emotionally while pretending I was all good, dealing with the fact that I was essesntially alone in the world, Not realising that later down Dylan would be the one to pull me from the absoulute dark-irrpsoiabable/out of control/ addict/crimainal I had become, offering to take me to he's house he shared with two others in laverton/hopperscorssing, which after being in an untrollable rage/tears in the passanger seat smashing the front paneel with fists in rage, but also pain.... emotianal pain, phhicsal pain had become abit of a joke... 
which was a crossroad in life that if haden't of happened.... would acutally be incredibily hard to convinse myself/anybody that the outcome from there would of surely being Jail/Death/visionless possibililtity.... But from there "both hes housemates "Matt and Nelson being Gay as fuck, super nice, not fucking Crims/Lads/Gang mentiallily/ Matt being incredibily illtentgent stuudying at uni, with a very safe outlook lifestyle, would cause me to after sleeping for like 2 days straight start to reset my brain, I would start smoking green everyday again, stayed away from cold, got another job at a club in bruswick that a friend was managaing, warehouse doof scene, which was okay, but not enough, no where near enough to live of/contriubute to house of.... I really can't stress this enough, but Dylan even though you were a bit of a dick at times, you put up with my shit, and even ended up telling me I could move to the House Matt and dylan were looking at rentning in kensongton of all places which would of been perfrct, but Matt being the most uptight, fincancilly senseable Gayest of gay fucks he was needed me to be able to conytuibute propely, which was completlyely fair and reasonable, which I knew at the time to, but as time does it kept ticking, and I would lose that job i had, and would get to the time in the past where i was sitting in an emety house, as the lease was up, once again being completely lost in where to go/how to proceeed, I would stay in the emety house for a short time before finally leaving after landlord came around a few times...
I would Tell dylan that I would stay at a hostel in the city, and he didn't need to worry about me, not tellijg him I wasen't working, didn't have ID, any form of concrecte planning direction/ect... And from there It would set the stage to the next chapter of my life, being on the streets in the city, melbourne CBD, was a fucking learn curve.....
I would sneak into my nannas in kensington occcasianly during the night after 12/1am to eat something/sleep on couch, which nanna didn't mind to much but unforuantelly "Jonny" lived there.... the junkie fucking dog..... which was a problem as I was not a conflict-averting-thinkB4Speaking mindset.... So it was to easy for conflict, and nanna didn't need that, so after a few weeks of sneaking in after midnight here and there, Had to stop....
Now truly on the streets, with no fallback/support.... Occasinally "Borrowing" sarcastic borrowng 20 here and there, and him bailing me out of a 800 coke debt that was there from years ago at pocket, having a gun drawn on my leg, having my phone taken, while being demamdned to pay.... Dylan would come through, and send me i think it was 300/400/500 which was enough to squash the part of me getting destoryed by jamal.....
eventually getting my phone back after paying a few hundred more the folliwing weeks
still on the streeet or better word "Homeless".... sleeping and spending stupid amounts of time at cydus "24/hr internet cafe, playing league alot, trying to get high "green" as often as possible.  Looking back there was a solid year of hard as fuck times, where being the idiot I was always pretending like eerything was fine, I wasen't on the streets, I had no vision/outlook was in crushing emeotial turmoil, addicted, just going day to day, some incredibly dark/cold/wet/shameful times spent, but al the while isolation in those times, as I was stuidlily proud and hated emabassing/shameful situations so I would try to avoid those moments which only made things harder.."no centerlink/no job/emotially destoryed/addicted/uneducated/ignorent/blinded/lack of self awereness/self control.... And atlast learn curve lol, depressing shit, but would lead me to be passing elizbeth street heading to cydus after picking up shifts at clubs, I had found a bag of coke, which was awesome cause i could sell it or trade it, "vividly still fresh though so long ago, I would meet on the steps on the corner of franklin and elibeth "Jax he's nrother sam and there more staight efge friend corey... I offered the coke, and jaxs response was to flick a bag of cold with the senstense to follow "we don't fuck with coke, talking shit about him being in an intiaulian mafia sitiation but was just a carasmatimic crackhead, who in the early days of being arround him was incrediibily intellegent coupled with the fact he was on the streets, but was just treating the city like a playground, dealing cold and green, I would then meet Charlotte through him, she was stupidly crudhing on him, which in a non homo way so was I, He was a 1 of a kind person to be around and just had a way of doing things that was unmatched, incredibly finess like, after months, Charlotte and I would bond over essestianlly being lost in he's mind as it was a beautiful mind, but dealing that shit, being a heavy user, there isn't a winning sneraro.... Charllote being a rather short, Black fringed hair, darkish personaility, that was essentially alone in melbournestudying at uni, with super rich parents, she lived on the 43rf flloor of Zen apartments on therry street, across the rd from maccas...
While I was still in the same situation, but at somepoint getting another job at Morris and jones on chapel, being a real posh cocktail bar, obviosusly was out of my confort zone, but was decent hours decent pay, day shifts, and was sourrounded by some well -tiogether people left right and center again, with the same vibes as the co-workers from crown..
So from there I fell for charlotte after spending countless time with her alone, smoking green, learning about each others past and future plans/hopes/ect, honestly we were Polar oppisites, lived dead oppisite lives, from the outside looking in anyone would assume she was just a spoilt rich asian with rich as fuck parents, smart advanced mathamatics major doubling in art history, studiying the resoisnse and famous female artists from those times, obviously eventually hooking up, and  becoming my girlfriend and years later my wife, and to this day we are still married. 

[ TO BE CONTUINED ] That was a big chunk of history, with heaps before, lots of events missed inbetween and still the time from 2017 to now to cover "2025" jesus
back to present, before crashing I need to get my #1/2 priotry checklist done. "This is done for as much clarity in my past/present and future as possible.
